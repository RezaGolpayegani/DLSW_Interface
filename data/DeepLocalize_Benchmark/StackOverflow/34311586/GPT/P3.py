# Here are some issues with the provided code snippets, and corrections based on the hints you've mentioned:

### Key Issues Identified:
# 1. **Activation function in the last layer**: The final layer uses the `softmax` activation function, which is generally used for multi-class classification. Since this is a binary classification problem (output is 0 or 1), `sigmoid` should be used.
# 2. **Inconsistent loss function**: When using a sigmoid activation in the final layer for binary classification, `binary_crossentropy` is a more appropriate loss function than `mean_squared_error`.
# 3. **Learning rate and momentum**: The learning rate in the second example (`0.001`) might be too low. Increasing it to a value like `0.01` can help the model converge faster.
# 4. **Epoch and batch size**: For small datasets like this, training for more epochs (e.g., 1000) with a batch size of 4 will likely yield better results.

### Fixed Code:
# ```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers.core import Dense, Dropout, Activation
from keras.optimizers import SGD
import numpy as np
import time

# Data
X = np.array([[1., 1.], [0., 0.], [1., 0.], [0., 1.], [1., 1.], [0., 0.]])
y = np.array([[0.], [0.], [1.], [1.], [0.], [0.]])

# Model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(2, input_dim=2, init='uniform'))  # Input layer
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))  # Hidden layer with sigmoid activation

model.add(Dense(3, init='uniform'))  # Hidden layer
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))  # Sigmoid activation for the hidden layer

# Final layer for binary classification
model.add(Dense(1, init='uniform'))
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))  # Sigmoid for binary classification

# Optimizer - slightly increased learning rate
sgd = SGD(lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)

# Compile the model with binary crossentropy loss
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=sgd, metrics=['accuracy'])

# Timing the training process
start_time = time.time()

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=1000, batch_size=4, verbose=1)

# End time for training
end_time = time.time()
print("Training time:", end_time - start_time)

# Evaluation on the training data
score = model.evaluate(X, y)
print("\nEvaluation Score:", score)

# Predictions
print("Prediction for [1, 0]:", model.predict(np.array([[1, 0]])))
print("Prediction for [0, 0]:", model.predict(np.array([[0, 0]])))
# ```

### Changes Made:
# 1. **Activation in the last layer**: Changed from `softmax` to `sigmoid` for binary classification.
# 2. **Loss function**: Changed from `mean_squared_error` to `binary_crossentropy`.
# 3. **Learning rate**: Increased the learning rate to `0.01` for faster convergence.
# 4. **Epochs**: Increased the number of epochs to 1000 to give the model more time to train.

# This should improve the model's accuracy and address the problems you highlighted.
