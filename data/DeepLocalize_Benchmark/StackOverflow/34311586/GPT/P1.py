# The code you've shared has several issues that may affect its performance and cause the model to have low accuracy. Here are some key problems and fixes:

### Problems:

# 1. **Layer Initialization**:
#    The `init` parameter in Dense layers is deprecated. You should replace it with `kernel_initializer`.

# 2. **Activation Function**:
#    - The last layer's activation function is `softmax`, which is typically used for multi-class classification. Since you're predicting a single output (`y` has a shape of (6,1)), a `sigmoid` activation function would be more appropriate.
   
# 3. **Loss Function**:
#    The loss function you're using is `mean_squared_error`, which is not ideal for binary classification. It is better to use `binary_crossentropy` for a binary classification problem.

# 4. **Callbacks**:
#    The `DeepLocalize` callback in the code does not exist in Keras. This may have been added erroneously or is custom, but it's not part of the standard Keras callbacks.

# 5. **Training Parameters**:
#    The number of epochs (`nb_epoch`) is deprecated. It should be replaced with `epochs`. Also, the training data size is too small, and a batch size of 32 might be too large compared to the dataset.

# ### Fixed Code:

# Here is the corrected version:

# ```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers.core import Dense, Dropout, Activation
from keras.optimizers import SGD
import numpy as np
import time

# Data
X = np.array([[1., 1.], [0., 0.], [1., 0.], [0., 1.], [1., 1.], [0., 0.]])
y = np.array([[0.], [0.], [1.], [1.], [0.], [0.]])

# Model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(2, input_dim=2, kernel_initializer='uniform'))
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
model.add(Dense(3, kernel_initializer='uniform'))
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
model.add(Dense(1, kernel_initializer='uniform'))
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))  # Use sigmoid for binary classification

# Compile the model
sgd = SGD(lr=0.001, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=sgd)  # Use binary_crossentropy for binary classification

# Train the model
start_time = time.time()
model.fit(X, y, epochs=20, batch_size=1)  # Set appropriate batch size

# Evaluate the model
end_time = time.time()
print("Time per second:", (end_time - start_time))
score = model.evaluate(X, y)
print("Score:", score)

# Predictions
print("Prediction for [1, 0]:", model.predict(np.array([[1., 0.]])))
print("Prediction for [0, 0]:", model.predict(np.array([[0., 0.]])))
# ```

### Key Fixes:

# 1. **Correct initialization syntax**: Changed `init='uniform'` to `kernel_initializer='uniform'`.
# 2. **Last layer activation**: Replaced `softmax` with `sigmoid` for binary classification.
# 3. **Loss function**: Changed `mean_squared_error` to `binary_crossentropy` for better accuracy in binary classification.
# 4. **Epoch parameter**: Used `epochs` instead of `nb_epoch`.
# 5. **Batch size**: Changed the batch size to 1 due to the small dataset.

# This corrected version should provide better accuracy for a binary classification task.
