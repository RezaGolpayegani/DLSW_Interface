It looks like you're trying to define a model using Keras, but you haven't provided any code yet. However, I can provide some general guidance on how to tune the parameters of a Keras model.

When tuning parameters, it's essential to use a robust and efficient method. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Use grid search or cross-validation**: These methods allow you to evaluate the performance of different hyperparameters on a held-out test set.
2. **Use optimization algorithms**: Algorithms like GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn can help you find the optimal combination of hyperparameters.
3. **Monitor and print metrics**: Keep track of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., as you tune your model.
4. **Use a grid search with random search**: Random search can be an effective way to explore the parameter space.

Here's some example code that demonstrates how to tune parameters using GridSearchCV:
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasRegressor
import numpy as np

def create_model(learning_rate, reg_lambda):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=KerasRegressor(lr=learning_rate), metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Define the parameters to tune
param_grid = {
    'learning_rate': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1],
    'reg_lambda': [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01]
}

# Create a random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Define the model with grid search
model = KerasRegressor(build_fn=create_model)
grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the best parameters and the corresponding score
print('Best parameters:', grid_search.best_params_)
print('Score:', grid_search.best_score_)
```
In this example, we define a model with two hyperparameters: learning rate and regularization strength. We then create an instance of KerasRegressor using GridSearchCV to find the optimal combination of these hyperparameters.

Note that this is just one way to tune parameters; you may need to adapt this approach to your specific problem and dataset.
